# WashRoc

WashRoc is a modern, high-performance landing page and marketing website for a Moroccan on-demand car wash service. As the frontend developer, I built a fully responsive, bilingual-ready interface that connects customers seeking home car wash services with verified providers, delivering a polished user experience with a focus on performance, accessibility, and conversion optimization.

## Project Overview

WashRoc serves as the digital storefront for a mobile car wash platform operating in Morocco. The website showcases the service to two distinct audiences: customers looking for convenient car washing solutions and service providers seeking flexible income opportunities. Built with Next.js 15 and React 19, the platform prioritizes speed, SEO, and a seamless user journey from discovery to app download.

## Key Features

- **Dual Audience Design**: Separate, tailored landing pages for customers (`/clients`) and service providers (`/prestataires`), each with unique value propositions and CTAs.
- **Smart Download Buttons**: Device-aware app download links that detect iOS, Android, or desktop and direct users to the appropriate app store.
- **Interactive App Gallery**: Showcase of mobile app screenshots with smooth animations and transitions.
- **Contact Form with Validation**: Fully functional contact form using React Hook Form and Zod schema validation with API integration.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices with Tailwind CSS.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Complete dark mode implementation with custom color schemes.
- **SEO Optimized**: Comprehensive metadata, OpenGraph tags, sitemap, and robots.txt for maximum search visibility.
- **Legal Compliance**: Complete set of legal pages including privacy policy, terms of use, and GDPR-compliant account deletion.

## My Contributions

As the frontend developer, I was responsible for:

- Building the entire frontend using **Next.js 15** with the App Router, leveraging Server Components for optimal performance and SEO.
- Designing and implementing a **responsive, modern UI** with TailwindCSS, including custom animations (float, bounce, shimmer effects) and a cohesive design system.
- Creating **reusable UI components** using Radix UI primitives, following the Shadcn/ui pattern for accessibility and consistency.
- Implementing **form handling and validation** with React Hook Form and Zod, including API integration for the contact form.
- Building **device-aware download buttons** that intelligently detect user platforms and direct to the appropriate app store.
- Optimizing **performance and SEO** through Next.js Image optimization, lazy loading, and comprehensive metadata configuration.
- Implementing **TikTok Pixel tracking** for marketing analytics and conversion tracking.
- Setting up a **custom Node.js server** for production deployment with specific port configuration.

The result is a visually striking, high-converting landing page that effectively communicates WashRoc's value proposition to both customers and service providers.
