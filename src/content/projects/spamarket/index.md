### What is?

SpaMarket is an e-commerce platform dedicated to offering a wide selection of beauty and personal care products. As the frontend developer, I was responsible for designing and developing the user interface, ensuring the website is both visually appealing and highly functional.

The project was built using Next.js (with the App Router) following best practices and the latest Next.js patterns, including Server Components, Server Actions, and Suspense for enhanced performance and maintainability. For state management, I utilized Zustand, and Shadcn UI was incorporated to create a clean, modern, and dynamic user interface. I used TailwindCSS to build a responsive and visually appealing design, ensuring consistency across all devices.

Key contributions:

Developed the entire frontend using Next.js, leveraging the latest features like Server Components and Server Actions to improve performance and scalability.

Implemented dynamic and responsive UI elements with TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI for a modern design and smooth user experience.

Managed application state using Zustand, ensuring fast and efficient state management.

Integrated Stripe for secure and seamless payment processing.

Focused on performance optimization by utilizing techniques like Suspense and ensuring the site was fully responsive and fast across different devices and browsers.

Collaborated with backend developers to integrate APIs for product data, user authentication, and payment processing.

The result is a polished and performant online store that offers a seamless shopping experience with smooth navigation, easy product discovery, and secure checkout, all while adhering to the best practices of modern web development.
