# KeySacan

KeySacan is a modern and performant real estate marketplace designed to simplify property discovery worldwide. As the frontend developer, I built a responsive, intuitive platform that combines interactive maps with seamless property browsing, leveraging cutting-edge web technologies to ensure speed, scalability, and an exceptional user experience.

## Project Overview

KeySacan enables users to discover, list, and manage properties for buying or renting across the world. With its tagline **"Scan. Connect. Simplify"**, the platform offers intuitive property search, interactive map exploration, and secure user authentication. Built with Next.js 16 and React 19, the platform prioritizes performance and maintainability while delivering a polished, modern interface.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Map Search**: Explore properties on Google Maps with clustering, custom markers, and location-based filtering.
- **Advanced Property Filtering**: Search by city, property type, surface area, price range, and sale/rental status.
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based auth with email verification, password reset, and remember-me functionality.
- **User Dashboard**: Manage profile, favorites, and viewing history from a personalized dashboard.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices with a mobile-first approach.
- **Dynamic UI**: Smooth animations and modern interactions powered by Framer Motion and Shadcn.
- **Blog System**: Property-related content with Markdown rendering and category filtering.

## My Contributions

As the frontend developer, I was responsible for:

- Building the entire frontend using **Next.js 16** with React 19, utilizing the App Router, Server Components, and React Compiler for optimal performance.
- Designing a responsive and modern UI with **TailwindCSS 4** and **Shadcn**, ensuring accessibility and consistency across all devices.
- Implementing **Google Maps integration** with custom clustering, QR code markers, and location-based property browsing.
- Building a robust authentication system with **Zustand** state management, JWT tokens, and secure cookie handling.
- Creating efficient data fetching patterns with **React Query** for caching, optimistic updates, and seamless API integration.
- Developing reusable form components with **React Hook Form** and **Zod** validation for type-safe user inputs.
- Optimizing performance through lazy loading, image optimization, and React 19's concurrent features.
- Collaborating with backend developers (Laravel API) to integrate endpoints for properties, authentication, and user management.

The result is a visually appealing, high-performing real estate platform that delivers a delightful property discovery experience.
