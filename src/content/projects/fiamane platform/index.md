# Fiamane

Fiamane is a dynamic platform that simplifies cross-continental shipping by connecting individuals with transporters and transportation agencies between Morocco and Europe. As the frontend developer, I crafted a modern, intuitive, and performant user interface that streamlines the process of posting shipments and finding available transport routes, leveraging modular components and type-safe development.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Fiamane enables users to post items for shipping or find transporters with available space for their goods. Transporters can share planned routes, making it easy to match with users needing shipping services. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, the platform delivers a seamless, accessible, and efficient experience for cross-border logistics.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Shipment Posting**: Users can easily list items for transport with detailed requirements.
- **Route Matching**: Transporters share travel routes, allowing users to find compatible shipping options.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Data**: Powered by SWR for efficient API-driven data fetching.
- **Interactive Tables**: Dynamic data display using TanStack Table for user-friendly browsing.

## 🛠️ My Contributions

As the frontend developer, I was responsible for:

- Building the frontend using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, ensuring type-safe, maintainable code with modular, reusable components.
- Designing a **modern and responsive UI** with TailwindCSS and Headless UI, delivering an accessible and visually cohesive experience across devices.
- Implementing **real-time data fetching** with React SWR for seamless API integration, enabling dynamic updates for shipment and route data.
- Creating **interactive data tables** with TanStack Table to enhance user interaction with listings.
- Integrating **Toastify** for user-friendly feedback notifications, improving the user experience during form submissions and API interactions.
- Optimizing **performance** with Next.js static generation, lazy loading, and efficient state management.

The result is a robust, user-centric platform that simplifies shipping logistics with a polished and efficient interface.
