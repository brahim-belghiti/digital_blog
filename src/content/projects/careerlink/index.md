### What is?

CareerLink is a modern recruitment platform designed to connect job seekers with employers efficiently. As the frontend developer, I led the design and development of the user interface, ensuring the platform is intuitive, visually engaging, and optimized for performance.

The project was built using Next.js with the App Router, following the latest best practices and leveraging cutting-edge features such as Server Components, Server Actions, and Suspense to deliver a seamless user experience and strong performance.

For styling, I utilized TailwindCSS to ensure a responsive and cohesive design across all devices. The UI was built using Shadcn UI, providing a clean, accessible, and dynamic visual experience consistent with modern web standards.

🔑 Key Contributions:
Developed the full frontend using Next.js, adopting the latest features like Server Components, Server Actions, and Suspense to improve performance and code maintainability.

Crafted a responsive and dynamic UI using TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI, creating an elegant, user-friendly experience for both job seekers and employers.

Integrated API endpoints for real-time job postings, user authentication, employer dashboards, and application tracking.

Focused on performance optimization, ensuring fast load times, smooth navigation, and a mobile-first experience across devices and browsers.
