reconciliation is the process by which React determines what has changed in the virtual DOM and updates the actual DOM efficiently. This process involves:
- **Diffing**: React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one.
- **Patch**: React applies the minimum set of changes to the actual DOM based on the diff.
