- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: In CSR, the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and uses JavaScript to render content dynamically in the browser.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: In SSR, the server generates the full HTML of a page and sends it to the client. Once the client receives the HTML, React "hydrates" it to enable client-side interactivity.
