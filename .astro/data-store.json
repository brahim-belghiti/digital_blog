It returns an array with two elements: **state**, which represents the current value of the state, and **setState**, a function used to directly update that value.\n\n**useReducer**\nis a powerful tool for managing complex state within functional components. Unlike useState, which is sufficient for simpler state management scenarios, useReducer employs the reducer pattern, similar to Redux. so the variable declared to store the state is not updated directly but inside a reducer function. The fundamental structure involves an initial state and an action that modifies it. Developers can define custom actions and implement a switch statement in the reducer function to determine how to update the state based on the received action.\n\n## side effect hooks\n**useEffect**\n A hook for handling side effects (like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually interacting with the DOM) in functional components.\n\t- **Without a dependency array**: Runs after every render.\n\t- **With an empty dependency array**: Runs only once, immediately after the initial render.\n\t- **With dependencies**: Runs whenever any value in the array changes.\n\n## context hooks\n**useContext**\nis to store state that can be accessed any where form the application, you wrap the application with the context and then you have access to it. So it is a way to share data (like themes or authentication state) between components without passing props manually down the component tree.\n\n## performance hooks\n**useMemo**\nis a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.by memorising expensive calculations so that they are only recalculated when necessary (e.g., when dependencies change).\n\n**useCallback** \nis a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders. by memorizing functions so that they don’t get recreated on every render unless their dependencies change.\n> **Note**: The need for `useMemo` and `useCallback` has reduced with improvements in React 19, but they can still be useful in performance-critical situations.\n\n## Ref hooks\n**useRef**\n_Refs_ let a component [hold some information that isn’t used for rendering,](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) like a DOM node or a timeout ID.

And [React use it to optimize updates to the actual DOM](./react-uses-a-virtual-dom-to-optimize-updates-to-the-actual-dom)\n\n### Built-in React Hooks\n[Built-in React hooks let you use different React features from your components](./built-in-react-hooks)\n\n---\n\n## rendering\n### client side rendering vs server side rendering\n[the difference between client side and server side rendering is in what sources are being sent to the client and when the full rendering of the page happens](./client-side-rendering-vs-server-side-rendering)\n\n#### Server Components\nReact Server Components allow rendering components on the server, which reduces the amount of JavaScript sent to the client and improves performance\n\n### reconciliation\n[reconciliation is the process by which React determines what has changed in the virtual DOM and updates the actual DOM efficiently](./reconciliation-is-the-process-by-which-react-determines-what-has-changed-in-the-virtual-dom-and-updates-the-actual-dom-efficiently)\n\n### life-cycle methods \nin React class components, lifecycle methods are divided into three main phases:\n1. **Mounting**: The phase when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.\n2. **Updating**: The phase when a component is being re-rendered due to changes in state or props.\n3. **Unmounting**: The phase when a component is being removed from the DOM..\n\n### lifecycle Methods in Functional Components (using Hooks):\n\nIn functional components, the equivalent lifecycle methods can be handled using the `useEffect` hook, which allows you to run side effects in different phases of the component's lifecycle.\n\n- `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`: This is equivalent to `componentDidMount()` and runs once when the component mounts.\n- `useEffect(() => { ... }, [dependencies])`: This is equivalent to `componentDidUpdate()` and runs whenever the specified dependencies change.\n- `useEffect(() => { return () => { ... } }, [])`: This is equivalent to `componentWillUnmount()` and runs when the component unmounts.\n\n---\n\n## Optimization \n### suspense\n[Suspense is React feature that allows you to suspend rendering until certain conditions are met, such as data loading or code splitting](./suspense-is-react-feature-that-allows-you-to-suspend-rendering-until-certain-conditions-are-met)\n\n### Concurrent Mode\n[[concurrent Mode in React enables applications to remain responsive and fluid by interrupting and prioritizing rendering tasks as needed.

It passes data and functions as props to the Presenter component.\n- **Presenter Component**: Focuses on rendering the UI, accepting props from the container.\n\n **Why Use This Pattern?**\n\n- Keeps components lean and focused on a single concern.\n- Simplifies testing as logic and UI are isolated.\n- Promotes reusability, as Presenter components can be reused with different data sources.\n\n **Example Implementation**\n\n```typescript\n// Container Component\nconst UserContainer = () => {\n  const [users, setUsers] = useState\u003CUser[]>([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchUsers = async () => {\n      const response = await fetch(\"/api/users\");\n      const data = await response.json();\n      setUsers(data);\n    };\n    fetchUsers();\n  }, []);\n\n  return \u003CUserList users={users} />;\n};\n\n// Presenter Component\nconst UserList = ({ users }: { users: User[] }) => (\n  \u003Cul>\n    {users.map((user) => (\n      \u003Cli key={user.id}>{user.name}\u003C/li>\n    ))}\n  \u003C/ul>\n);\n\n// App Component\nconst App = () => \u003CUserContainer />;\n```\n\n\n### **Hooks**\n\n**Detailed Description**\n\n- Encapsulate logic into custom hooks to make it reusable and separate it from rendering concerns.\n\n **Why Use This Pattern?**\n\n- Makes logic reusable and composable.\n- Keeps components cleaner by extracting non-UI logic.\n\n **Example Implementation**\n\n```typescript\n// the custom hook useFetch\nconst useFetch = (url: string) => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      const response = await fetch(url);\n      const result = await response.json();\n      setData(result);\n      setLoading(false);\n    };\n    fetchData();\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading };\n};\n\n// Usage\nconst App = () => {\n  const { data, loading } = useFetch(\"/api/data\");\n  return loading ? \u003Cp>Loading...\u003C/p> : \u003Cdiv>{JSON.stringify(data)}\u003C/div>;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n### using a clear folder structure\nuse a folders to separate concerns.\n```\n├── components\n│   ├── ui\n│   │   ├── DataTable.tsx\n│   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   └── table.tsx\n│   ├── complex componnents\n│   │   ├── Navabar.tsx\n│   │   └── ...\n├── config\n│   ├── env.ts\n├── constants\n│   ├── data.ts\n├── hooks\n│   ├── useAuth.tsx\n│   ├── useDebounce.tsx\n│   ├── useFetch.tsx\n│   ├── useLocale.tsx\n│   ├── useParams.tsx\n│   └── useTranslation.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── layouts\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   ├── ..\n├── pages\n│   ├── 404.tsx\n│   ├── forgot-password.tsx\n│   ├── index.tsx\n│   ├── login.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── public\n│   ├── Assets\n├── services\n├── styles\n├── types\n├── utils\n│   └── helpers\n│   │   ├── index.ts\n│   │   └── validators.ts\n\n\n```\n\n### Using utils and helper functions\nextract logic into helpers functions inside a utils folder, and files inside the folder are pure typescript. to avoid being tied to React paradigm if you don't have to (sometime even custom hooks can be just be extracted to be a pure typescript instead of being a React function.)","src/content/blog/React application architecture/index.md","69d59ef570f1f439",{"html":245,"metadata":246},"\u003Cp>React is a library not a framework, so React doesn’t impose a structure for your application, how many pattern have been established to build maintainable, scale-able React applications\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"container-presenter-pattern\">\u003Cstrong>Container-Presenter Pattern\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Detailed Description\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Container Component\u003C/strong>: Handles all logic, such as fetching data, state management, and event handlers.

React JS props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component",["Date","2024-12-18T23:00:00.000Z"],[18],"- **Definition**: Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.\n- **Characteristics**:\n    - They enable a unidirectional data flow, ensuring that data flows from parent to child.\n    - Props are read-only, meaning a child component cannot modify them (immutable).\n\nIn React, the concepts of **default props** and **PropTypes** (or TypeScript interfaces) are used to ensure that the props passed to a component are handled properly, with the right data types and default values. Here's a breakdown of each concept:\n\n### 1. **Default Props**\n\nDefault props in React are used to define default values for props that are passed to a component. If a prop is not provided by the parent component, the default value will be used instead.\n\nFor example:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst MyComponent = ({ name, age }) => {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>Name: {name}\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cp>Age: {age}\u003C/p>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n\n// Set default props\nMyComponent.defaultProps = {\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  age: 30,\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\nIn this example, if `name` or `age` is not passed by the parent, `John Doe` and `30` will be used as default values.\n\n### 2. **PropTypes (Prop Validation)**\n\nPropTypes is a feature in React that allows you to specify the types of props a component should receive. This helps catch potential bugs by validating that the data passed into a component is of the expected type.\n\nFor example:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\n\nconst MyComponent = ({ name, age }) => {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>Name: {name}\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cp>Age: {age}\u003C/p>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n\n// Define prop types\nMyComponent.propTypes = {\n  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n  age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `name` is expected to be a string and is **required**.\n- `age` is expected to be a number and is also **required**.\n\nIf the parent component passes a prop of the wrong type (e.g., `name` as a number instead of a string), React will log a warning in the console.\n\n### 3. **TypeScript Interfaces (for Prop Validation)**\n\nTypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. Instead of using PropTypes, you can define an interface to describe the shape of the props in a React component. This provides type safety at compile time, helping to prevent errors and ensure that the right data types are passed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\ninterface MyComponentProps {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC\u003CMyComponentProps> = ({ name, age }) => {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>Name: {name}\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cp>Age: {age}\u003C/p>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\nHere, `MyComponentProps` defines the expected types for the `name` and `age` props. TypeScript will enforce that the parent component provides the correct types for these props.\n\n### Key Differences:\n\n- **Default Props** provide fallback values for props if they are not provided by the parent component.\n- **PropTypes** are used to validate the types of props passed to a component, helping catch errors at runtime.\n- **TypeScript interfaces** provide type safety for props at compile-time, offering stronger guarantees about data types compared to PropTypes.\n\nIn summary, default props give fallback values, PropTypes offer runtime type validation, and TypeScript interfaces give compile-time type safety, making your code more robust and easier to maintain.","src/content/blog/In React JS props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component/index.md","34d6f1798f5df05d",{"html":317,"metadata":318},"\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Definition\u003C/strong>: Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Characteristics\u003C/strong>:\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>They enable a unidirectional data flow, ensuring that data flows from parent to child.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Props are read-only, meaning a child component cannot modify them (immutable).\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>In React, the concepts of \u003Cstrong>default props\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>PropTypes\u003C/strong> (or TypeScript interfaces) are used to ensure that the props passed to a component are handled properly, with the right data types and default values.

Suspense is React feature that allows you to suspend rendering until certain conditions are met, such as data loading or code splitting. It’s commonly used with `React.lazy()` for code splitting, allowing React to wait for a component to be loaded before rendering it. \nAdditionally, **Suspense** lets you define a fallback component that will be displayed while the suspended component is being loaded, providing a smoother user experience.\n\nCode splitting is used to dynamically import a dependency, instead of directly importing in it.

While this works, it's not ideal—especially for sites with dynamic content like blogs, product listings, or portfolios.\n\nA static sitemap requires you to manually list all the pages, which doesn’t scale well. Thankfully, Next.js provides a pattern to **dynamically generate your sitemap** using a `sitemap.ts` file.\n\n## 🧩 The General Approach\n\nThere are two types of content to handle in a sitemap:\n\n1. **Static pages** – These are routes you hardcode, like `/about` or `/contact`.\n2. **Dynamic pages** – These are generated from a database or API, like blog posts or product pages.\n\n## 🔧 Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n1. **Define your static routes in an array.**\n2. **Create a function to fetch dynamic content (e.g., blog posts).**\n3. **Map the dynamic content to an array of sitemap entries.**\n4. **Combine both arrays and return them from your `sitemap.ts` function.**\n\n\n## 🙅‍♂️ Skip Protected Routes\n\nYou **shouldn’t include protected or authenticated-only routes** (e.g., admin panels, dashboards, or user settings) in your sitemap. These pages require login and aren't meant for indexing by search engines.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Code Example\n\n```ts\nimport type { MetadataRoute } from 'next'\nimport { getAllArticles } from '@/lib/actions/blog'\n\nconst BASE_URL = 'https://careerlink.ma'\n\n// 1. Static routes\nconst routes = [\n  '',\n  '/blog',\n  '/contact',\n  '/fiches-metiers',\n  '/legal/conditions-utilisation',\n  '/legal/cookies',\n  '/legal/mentions-legales',\n  '/legal/politique-confidentialite',\n  '/login',\n  '/register',\n  '/recruteurs',\n  '/recruteurs/tarification',\n  '/reset-password',\n  '/verifiction-email',\n]\n\n// 2. Dynamic blog posts\nasync function getAllBlogArticles() {\n  try {\n    const response = await getAllArticles(1, 1000)\n    if (!response?.data) return []\n\n    return response.data.map(article => ({\n      slug: article.slug,\n      lastModified:\n        article.updated_at || article.created_at || new Date().toISOString(),\n    }))\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching blog articles for sitemap:', error)\n    return []\n  }\n}\n\n// 3. Main sitemap function\nexport default async function sitemap(): Promise\u003CMetadataRoute.Sitemap> {\n\n  const staticRouteEntries = routes.map(route => ({\n    url: `${BASE_URL}${route}`,\n    lastModified: new Date(),\n    changeFrequency: 'weekly',\n    priority: route === '' ? 1.0 : 0.8,\n  }))\n\n  const blogArticles = await getAllBlogArticles()\n  const blogEntries = blogArticles.map(article => ({\n    url: `${BASE_URL}/blog/${article.slug}`,\n    lastModified: new Date(article.lastModified),\n    changeFrequency: 'weekly',\n    priority: 0.7,\n  }))\n\n  return [...staticRouteEntries, ...blogEntries]\n}\n```\n## 🤖 Don’t Forget the `robots.txt` File\n\n Make sure to include a `robots.txt` file in the root of your `public/` directory. Without it, Google might ignore or block your sitemap submission.\n ##### Example: `public/robots.txt`\n\n```\nUser-agent: *\nAllow: /\nSitemap: https://careerlink.ma/sitemap.xml\n```\nThis file tells search engine crawlers where to find your sitemap and gives them permission to crawl the site.\nsource: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap","src/content/blog/how to add a sitemap in nextjs/index.md","a5c52768d3648eff",{"html":396,"metadata":397},"\u003Ch1 id=\"️-how-to-generate-a-dynamic-sitemap-in-nextjs-app-router\">🗺️ How to Generate a Dynamic Sitemap in Next.js (App Router)\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>If you’re building a Next.js app and want to add a sitemap, your first instinct might be to drop a \u003Ccode>sitemap.xml\u003C/code> file in the \u003Ccode>app\u003C/code> directory.

Instead, we can create a root `Layout` component that encapsulates these shared elements and renders specific page content dynamically. \n\n**Solution**  \nDefine a `Layout` component that acts as a wrapper for shared components and renders child components dynamically,  the child components are passed as [[in React JS props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component|props]] :\n\n```typescript\n\n/** the layout component */\nconst Layout=({children}:{childre: React.ReactNode})=>{\nreturn (\n\u003C>\n\u003Cheader>\n\u003Cnav>\n  what whill be shard between all pages\n\u003C/nav>\n\u003C/header>\n  \u003Cmain>\n  {children}\n  \u003C/main>\n\u003C/>\n);\n}\n\n /** using the layout component */\n\n const page = ()=> {\n  return (\n  \u003C>\n    \u003CLayout>\n    \u003Csection>\n     \u003Cp>the content of the page\u003C/p>\n    \u003C/section>\n    \u003C/Layout>\n  \u003C/>\n  )\n \n }\n```\n\n**Key Benefits**  \n- **Reusability**: Centralizes shared elements in a single component.  \n- **Consistency**: Ensures layout elements like navigation or footers remain uniform across pages.  \n- **Maintainability**: Any change to shared elements is done in one place.  \n\n### Authentication Flow \n**Problem Statement**  \nAuthentication ensures that the user requesting access to the application is valid. The goal is to securely validate user credentials while providing feedback and ensuring a good user experience.\n**Solution Breakdown**  \n1. **UI Management**:  \n   - **State Management**: Use `useState` or `useReducer` for managing input values and UI states (loading, errors, etc.).  \n   - **Input Validation**: Libraries like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) can ensure input adheres to required schemas.  \n\n1. **Backend Communication**:  \n   - **Request Handling**: Use `useEffect` for communicating with the server.  \n   - **Custom Hook**: Abstract the request logic into a custom hook for better reusability and encapsulation. \n```typescript\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\n# shema validation with zod\nconst schema = z.object({\n  email: z.string().email(\"Invalid email address\"),\n  password: z.string().min(6, \"Password must be at least 6 characters long\"),\n});\n/** custom hooks for communicating with the backend (Authentification happens on the server) */\nconst useAuthenticate = ()=>{\nconst [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)\nuseEffect(()=>{\n   setLoading(true);\n   try{\n      cnst re\n   }\n   catch (error) {\n   }\n   finaly {\n   }\n\n}, [])\n}\n/** component for the UI that handles getting data from the user and displayig back the repsonse */\n\n```\n\n### **Authorization**\n\n**Problem Statement**  \nauthorization is about making sure the identified user, have access the features of the application in react term, that the user have access to routes.\nauthorization happens in the back-end first, and then depending on the answer from the server you either give access the user request on not.\n\n**Solution breakdown**\nusing the concept of **conditional rendering** you can show the parts of the application that user has access to.\n**Solution**\n- Perform authorization checks on the server.\n- On the client, use **conditional rendering** to hide unauthorized features.\n- For route protection, use libraries like `react-router` to implement guards.\n\n```typescript\nconst ProtectedComponent = ({ isAuthorized }: { isAuthorized: boolean }) => {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      {isAuthorized ? (\n        \u003Cp>Welcome to the protected content.\u003C/p>\n      ) : (\n        \u003Cp>You do not have access.\u003C/p>\n      )}\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### fetching data\nfetching data, is a site effect, is a state that lives in the server. so you need to use a mechanism to deal with fetching data form the server and synchronize it with client application state. React offers the [[useEffect is a hook for performing side effects|useEffect]] to deal with side Effect. And they are third library for better workflows and patters like SWR and React Query.\n\n**Best Practices**\n\n- fetching date asynchronously  \n- having a loading state to use display UI when data is loading\n- managing error and have UI to display to the user if an error happens.\n- cash the fetched data for better performance \n- re-fetch data periodically to have the data always updated\n\n```typescript\nimport { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\n\nconst useFetchData = (url: string) => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState\u003Cany>(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState\u003Cstring | null>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      setLoading(true);\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(url);\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(\"Failed to fetch data\");\n        const result = await response.json();\n        setData(result);\n      } catch (err: any) {\n        setError(err.message);\n      } finally {\n        setLoading(false);\n      }\n    };\n    fetchData();\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n};\n\n// Usage\nconst DataComponent = () => {\n  const { data, loading, error } = useFetchData(\"/api/data\");\n\n  if (loading) return \u003Cp>Loading...\u003C/p>;\n  if (error) return \u003Cp>{error}\u003C/p>;\n\n  return \u003Cdiv>{JSON.stringify(data)}\u003C/div>;\n};\n\n```\n\n### Extracting Custom Hooks\n\n**Problem Statement**\nAs React applications grow in complexity, combining logic and UI in the same component makes the code harder to maintain, test, and reuse. Separating logic into custom hooks can resolve this issue.\n\n**Solution**\n[[custom hooks in React abstract reusable logic and separate it from the rendering process in components, enhancing code reuse, readability, and maintainability across the application.]]\n\n**Key Benefits**\n\n- **Reusability**: Logic can be reused across multiple components.\n- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps components focused on UI.\n- **Simplified Testing**: Hooks can be tested independently of UI.\n\n### Composing Modular Components\n\n**Problem Statement**\nComplex components often become bloated and difficult to manage. Breaking them into smaller, reusable pieces improves readability and maintainability.\n\n**Solution**\n[[the most important design pattern in React is component composition.]] and it is done by [[extracting components in React promotes re-usability, adheres to the single responsibility principle, enhances readability, simplifies testing, and improves encapsulation of functionality, resulting in a more maintainable code-base.]]\n\n**Key Benefits**\n\n- **Reusability**: Smaller components can be reused across the app.\n- **Readability**: Simplifies understanding of individual components.\n- **Scalability**: Easier to manage and extend functionality.\n\n\n### Separating Logic Components from Display Components\n\n**Problem Statement**\nMixing logic and display code in the same component makes it harder to test, reuse, and maintain.\n\n**Solution**\nCreate container components for logic and presentation components for UI. Pass data as props from the container to the presentation component.\n\n```typescript\n// this the logic component responsile for logic (in this case it has data, but normaly the data will be fetched form a server)\nconst BlogContainer = () => {\n  const blogData = [\n    { id: 1, title: \"First Post\" },\n    { id: 2, title: \"Second Post\" },\n  ];\n\n  return \u003CBlogList blogs={blogData} />;\n};\n\n// this is the presentation component is only responsible for displaying data passed to it by props.\nconst BlogList = ({ blogs }: { blogs: { id: number; title: string }[] }) => {\n  return (\n    \u003Cul>\n      {blogs.map((blog) => (\n        \u003Cli key={blog.id}>{blog.title}\u003C/li>\n      ))}\n    \u003C/ul>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n**Key Benefits**\n- **Readability**: Clear separation between logic and UI.\n- **Reusability**: Presentation components can be used in multiple places.\n- **Testability**: Logic can be tested independently.\n\n### Routing\n\n**Problem Statement**\nSingle Page Applications (SPAs) need routing to navigate between different views or pages. Managing routes effectively is essential for user experience and maintainability.\n\n**Solution**\nUse libraries like `react-router` or frameworks like Next.js to define routes and handle navigation.\n\n```typescript\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nconst HomePage = () => \u003Ch1>Home\u003C/h1>;\nconst AboutPage = () => \u003Ch1>About\u003C/h1>;\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    \u003CRouter>\n      \u003CSwitch>\n        \u003CRoute path=\"/\" exact component={HomePage} />\n        \u003CRoute path=\"/about\" component={AboutPage} />\n      \u003C/Switch>\n    \u003C/Router>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n**Key Benefits**\n\n- **Navigation**: Enables seamless transitions between views.\n- **Scalability**: Simplifies management of multiple pages.\n- **SEO**: Frameworks like Next.js improve search engine optimization.\n\n### Form Validation\n\n**Problem Statement**\nForms are integral to web applications, but ensuring user input is valid can be complex without proper validation techniques.\n\n**Solution**\nUse libraries like Zod or React Hook Form for robust form validation.\n\n```typescript\nimport { useForm } from \"react-hook-form\";\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\nimport { zodResolver } from \"@hookform/resolvers/zod\";\n\n// the schema for validation with zod\nconst schema = z.object({\n  email: z.string().email(\"Invalid email\"),\n  password: z.string().min(6, \"Password must be at least 6 characters\"),\n});\n// the form component using the zod schema to validate data on the clinent\nconst LoginForm = () => {\n  const {\n    register,\n    handleSubmit,\n    formState: { errors },\n  } = useForm({ resolver: zodResolver(schema) });\n\n  const onSubmit = (data: any) => {\n    console.log(data);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cform onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n      \u003Cdiv>\n        \u003Clabel>Email:\u003C/label>\n        \u003Cinput {...register(\"email\")} />\n        {errors.email && \u003Cp>{errors.email.message}\u003C/p>}\n      \u003C/div>\n      \u003Cdiv>\n        \u003Clabel>Password:\u003C/label>\n        \u003Cinput type=\"password\" {...register(\"password\")} />\n        {errors.password && \u003Cp>{errors.password.message}\u003C/p>}\n      \u003C/div>\n      \u003Cbutton type=\"submit\">Login\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/form>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n**Key Benefits**\n\n- **User Experience**: Provides immediate feedback to users.\n- **Consistency**: Ensures data integrity before submission.\n- **Efficiency**: Reduces errors with declarative validation schemas.\n\n### Working with Typescript\n\n**Problem Statement**\nReact applications require a way to ensure type safety, especially in larger projects. Without TypeScript, type-related errors might only surface at runtime, leading to bugs and inefficiencies.\n\n**Solution**\nUse Typescript to define the types of props, state, function parameters, and API responses. This helps catch errors during development and improves code clarity.\n\n```typescript\n// Typing component props\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: string;\n  onClick: () => void;\n}\n\nconst Button = ({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) => {\n  return \u003Cbutton onClick={onClick}>{label}\u003C/button>;\n};\n\n// Typing API responses\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n}\n\nconst fetchUsers = async (): Promise\u003CUser[]> => {\n  const response = await fetch(\"/api/users\");\n  return response.json();\n};\n\n// Typing hooks\nconst useCounter = (initialValue: number): [number, () => void] => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);\n  const increment = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1);\n  return [count, increment];\n};\n```\n\n**Key Benefits**\n\n- **Type Safety**: Prevents runtime errors by enforcing types at compile time.\n- **Documentation**: Acts as self-documenting code.\n- **Developer Experience**: Improves autocompletion and reduces debugging time.\n\n### Filtering & Searching Data\n\n**Problem Statement**  \nImplementing filtering and searching logic in applications can lead to excessive state management and performance bottlenecks if not handled properly. Derived states can often replace redundant state storage.\n\n**Solution**  \nLeverage JavaScript's array methods like `filter` and `map` to dynamically process data. Store only the essential query parameters in the state or URL for persistence.\n\n```typescript\nconst SearchableList = ({ items }: { items: string[] }) => {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState(\"\");\n\n  const filteredItems = useMemo(() => {\n    return items.filter((item) => item.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()));\n  }, [query, items]);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cinput\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Search...\"\n        value={query}\n        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      \u003Cul>\n        {filteredItems.map((item, index) => (\n          \u003Cli key={index}>{item}\u003C/li>\n        ))}\n      \u003C/ul>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n\n```\n\n**Key Benefits**\n\n- **Efficiency**: Avoids unnecessary state management by deriving filtered data.\n- **Flexibility**: Enables dynamic filtering without pre-computation.\n- **Persistence**: Query parameters in the URL allow users to share filtered views.\n\n\n### Working with Tables\n\n**Problem Statement**  \nDisplaying tabular data is a common use case in web applications. Without proper libraries, managing features like sorting, pagination, and filtering manually can be cumbersome and error-prone.\n\n**Solution**  \nUse a library like [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8) to simplify working with tables. TanStack Table is highly customizable and supports advanced features like server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering.\n\n```typescript\nimport { useTable, Column } from \"@tanstack/react-table\";\n\ntype Data = {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n};\n\nconst data: Data[] = [\n  { id: 1, name: \"John\", age: 25 },\n  { id: 2, name: \"Jane\", age: 30 },\n  { id: 3, name: \"Smith\", age: 28 },\n];\n\nconst columns: Column\u003CData>[] = [\n  {\n    accessorKey: \"name\",\n    header: \"Name\",\n  },\n  {\n    accessorKey: \"age\",\n    header: \"Age\",\n  },\n];\n\nconst TableComponent = () => {\n  const { getHeaderGroups, getRowModel } = useTable({ data, columns });\n\n  return (\n    \u003Ctable>\n      \u003Cthead>\n        {getHeaderGroups().map((headerGroup) => (\n          \u003Ctr key={headerGroup.id}>\n            {headerGroup.headers.map((header) => (\n              \u003Cth key={header.id}>{header.renderHeader()}\u003C/th>\n            ))}\n          \u003C/tr>\n        ))}\n      \u003C/thead>\n      \u003Ctbody>\n        {getRowModel().rows.map((row) => (\n          \u003Ctr key={row.id}>\n            {row.getVisibleCells().map((cell) => (\n              \u003Ctd key={cell.id}>{cell.renderCell()}\u003C/td>\n            ))}\n          \u003C/tr>\n        ))}\n      \u003C/tbody>\n    \u003C/table>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n**Key Benefits**  \n- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the implementation of common table features.  \n- **Customizability**: Provides flexibility for advanced use cases.  \n- **Performance**: Optimized for handling large datasets.\n\n### Using External Libraries\n\n**Problem Statement**  \nBuilding complex features from scratch can be time-consuming and may lead to inconsistent implementations. Relying on community-driven libraries can accelerate development while ensuring best practices.\n\n**Solution**  \nIdentify and integrate trusted external libraries for specific use cases. For example:\n- **State Management**: `Redux`, `Zustand`.\n- **Data Fetching**: `React Query`, `Axios`.\n- **Form Validation**: `React Hook Form`, `Zod`.\n- **Styling**: `Tailwind CSS`, `Styled Components`.\n\n**Key Benefits**  \n- **Time Efficiency**: Reduces development effort.  \n- **Community Support**: Access to documentation and community expertise.  \n- **Standardization**: Encourages adherence to widely accepted patterns.\n\n### i18n (Internationalization)\n\n**Problem Statement**  \nSupporting multiple languages in a React application can be challenging without a proper framework for managing translations and locale-based content.\n\n**Solution**  \nUse libraries like `react-i18next` to manage translations and locale switching.\n\n```typescript\nimport { useTranslation } from \"react-i18next\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();\n\n  const changeLanguage = (lang: string) => {\n    i18n.changeLanguage(lang);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Ch1>{t(\"welcome_message\")}\u003C/h1>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => changeLanguage(\"en\")}>English\u003C/button>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => changeLanguage(\"es\")}>Español\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n**Key Benefits**  \n- **Scalability**: Simplifies managing multiple languages.  \n- **User Experience**: Provides locale-specific content seamlessly.  \n- **Community Support**: Popular libraries like `react-i18next` have extensive resour\n\n### Ways to Improve Performance\n\n**Problem Statement**  \nReact applications can suffer from performance bottlenecks due to unnecessary re-renders, large bundles, and inefficient state management.\n\n**Solution**  \nOptimize performance using the following strategies:\n- **Code Splitting**: Use dynamic `import()` to load components only when needed.\n- **React.memo**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components.\n- **useMemo** and **useCallback**: Optimize expensive calculations and function references.\n- **Lazy Loading**: Defer loading of non-critical resources.\n\n```typescript\nimport React, { memo, useMemo, useCallback }

styles with components.  \n- **Maintainability**: Reduces style conflicts.  \n- **Flexibility**: Supports dynamic and theme-based styling.\n\n\n### pass data in the routes\nyou can pass data in the routes and get them with the browser api.\n\n### state management (different states : global, local, server)\nlocal state : use useState or useReducer\nglobal : useContext or state mangement library like redux\nserver state : state in the server, use useState with useEffect or a third library like swr or React Query\n\n\n### conditional rendering\n[[conditional rendering is conditioning the rendering of UI elements depending on a value]]\n\n### working with arrays\nworking with arrays is like javascript, the only thing to be aware off is when rendering elements from array is to make sure each component has it own unique key.\n\n### updating state with useState\nupdate state with useState is very straight forward however, it may be tricky with array and object. so for object and array they must be destructed first then be updated\nso it always recorded to use the the full syntax that use the current state as an argument.","src/content/blog/Techniques to practice about React

To include multiple elements, wrap them in a parent element like a `\u003Cdiv>` or use a React fragment (`\u003C>...\u003C/>`).\n\n```typescript\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    \u003C>\n      \u003Cheader>Header\u003C/header>\n      \u003Cmain>Content\u003C/main>\n    \u003C/>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n### React is a JavaScript Library  \nAnything that can be achieved using JavaScript can be implemented in React since React is fundamentally a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n\n### Unidirectional Data Flow  \nIn React, data flows in a single direction: from parent to child via props. Props are read-only and should not be modified by child components. \n\n```typescript\nconst Parent = () => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(\"Hello\");\n\n  return \u003CChild message={data} />;\n};\n\nconst Child = ({ message }: { message: string }) => {\n  return \u003Cp>{message}\u003C/p>;\n};\n```\n\nNote: you can update the state of the parent component from the child component by passing setState as props.\n\n(use callbacks to send data back to the parent if needed.) ???\n\n\n### JSX Expressions  \nWithin JSX, you can only write JavaScript expressions inside `{}`. Statements like `if` or `for` must be rewritten as expressions or moved outside JSX.\n\n```typescript\nconst MyComponent = ({ condition }: { condition: boolean }) => {\n  return \u003Cdiv>{condition ? \"True\" : \"False\"}\u003C/div>;\n};\n```\n\n\n### Key for Array Items  \nWhen rendering lists using `map`, ensure each element has a unique `key` to help React identify which items have changed, added, or removed.\nand avoid using index, use the the id if it exist.\n\n```typescript\nconst List = ({ items }: { items: string[] }) => {\n  return (\n    \u003Cul>\n      {items.map((item, index) => (\n        \u003Cli key={item.id}>{item.name}\u003C/li>\n      ))}\n    \u003C/ul>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n **Why Avoid Using Index as a Key?**\n\n1. **Re-rendering Issues**:  \n    When the list order changes, React may not correctly associate the previous state with the new element, leading to unexpected behavior.\n    \n2. **State Preservation**:  \n    Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Using the index can confuse React if the list order changes, causing incorrect state persistence.\n    \n3. **Performance**:  \n    Using unique and stable keys ensures React performs updates efficiently.\n\n### Hooks Must Not Be Conditioned  \nReact hooks must be called at the top level of a component or custom hook. They cannot be placed inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.\n\n```typescript\nconst MyComponent = ({ condition }: { condition: boolean }) => {\n  // This is incorrect:\n  // if (condition) {\n  //   const [state, setState] = useState(false);\n  // }\n\n  const [state, setState] = useState(false); // Correct usage\n\n  return \u003Cp>{state.toString()}\u003C/p>;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n### Accessing Browser APIs  \nReact has access to all browser APIs because it is JavaScript. However, be cautious with server-side rendered components (like in Next.js), as they do not have access to browser-specific APIs.\n\n```typescript\nconst WindowWidth = () => {\n  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);\n    window.addEventListener(\"resize\", handleResize);\n    return () => window.removeEventListener(\"resize\", handleResize);\n  }, []);\n\n  return \u003Cp>Window width: {width}\u003C/p>;\n};\n```\n\n\n### Exporting Components  \nFor a component to be usable in other files, you must export it. Typically, React components are exported as default exports.\n\n```typescript\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return \u003Ch1>Hello World\u003C/h1>;\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```","src/content/blog/Rules of React JS/index.md","50c92c89efe1299e",{"html":549,"metadata":550},"\u003Ch3 id=\"react-component-must-return-a-single-element\">React Component Must Return a Single Element\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>React enforces that components return a single root element.

coverage in 9 languages (French, Arabic, Bengali, Spanish, Romanian, Tamil, Turkish, Vietnamese, Chinese).\n- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive user management, analytics, article publishing, and contact message handling.\n- **GDPR Compliance**: User data export, account anonymization, and consent-based data handling.\n\n## My Contributions\n\nAs the full-stack developer, I was responsible for:\n\n- Architecting and building the entire backend using **Laravel 12**, implementing RESTful APIs with token-based authentication (Sanctum), rate limiting, and role-based access control.\n- Designing the database schema with **18 Eloquent models**, optimized migrations, and efficient relationships for handling questions, lessons, exams, and user progress.\n- Developing the admin dashboard using **React 19** with **TypeScript**, **Inertia.js** for seamless SPA navigation, and **Shadcn UI** for a modern, accessible interface.\n- Implementing the complete authentication flow including email verification with 6-digit codes, password reset functionality, and multi-device session management.\n- Building the exam and practice session system with pause/resume capabilities, answer persistence, and detailed statistics tracking.\n- Creating CLI commands for bulk content import (questions, lessons from CSV), automatic series generation, and media validation.\n- Integrating monitoring tools (**Laravel Pulse**, **Telescope**) and auto-generated API documentation with **Scribe**.\n- Optimizing performance through caching strategies, efficient database queries, and lazy loading.\n\nThe result is a production-ready educational platform that delivers a seamless learning experience while providing administrators with powerful content management tools.\n\n## Tech
